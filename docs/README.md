# Parallax Developer Docs

The Parallax developer docs is an ever-evolving knowledge base for both frontend and backend developers, created for ourselves (and future selves) to encourage tip sharing, best practices and efficient workflows. They're the way we like to do things, and consist of anything and everything we think is worth noting. These are split into 3 categories; guides, best practices and code style.

## 📚 Guides

Guides are used to explain concepts with easy to follow instructions, code examples, and gotchas. They can be on any subject from dealing with a specific package to general language support.

## 👨🏻‍🏫 Best Practises

Best practices ensure the entire team knows what is expected when it comes to things like testing, accessibility, and performance.

## 🔏 Code Style

This is where we talk about how we style our code, whether to omit semi-colons in Javascript for example, what our linter settings should look like, and so on.
